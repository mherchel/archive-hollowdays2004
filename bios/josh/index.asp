        was born in Paltakakaka. When I was one, I stuck a bobby pin in my nose 
        and had to have it removed surgically. I blew up grasshoppers for fun 
        until I was about 13. I learned to bust my ass on a skateboard after that. 
        Then I got a guitar. Now I'm in a band and writing a bio. <br>

        <br>
        My character type is INFP. My favorite song is &quot;Yellow Ledbetter,&quot; 
        with &quot;Black&quot; in a close second. If I had a million dollars, 
        the first thing that I would do is buy a pool and fill it with m&amp;ms 
        to go for an indefinite swim with Mandy Moore...to be continued<br>
