        1935 the German think tank manager <b>Jorge Williams</b> prophesized that 
        in the early 1980's a child would be born. The child would be born with 
        the ability to keep time and rythem in an <i>uncanny</i> way. Before the 
        child was even born, his mother patted her belly to the rhythm and beat 
        to the great music of the time, <b>David Bowie</b>, <b>The Who</b>, <b>The 
        Police</b>, <b>The Loving Spoonfull</b>, <b>Cyndi Lauper</b>, underground 
        bootlegged <b>Metallica</b> no life till leather tapes, And a many assortment 
        of random artists. Little did she know that she would be molding the prophesized 
        one to be the <i>greatest</i> drummer ever. Under the cleaving moons of 
        BA and Uri the child was born. When he was 4 he was given an indian totem 
        drum. The child soon broke it. When he was 12 and in public school he 
        was given the choice of playing tuba or the drums, the choice being <i><b>predetermined</b>. 
        </i> He chose the snare drum. With the cards on the table and the motions 
        set into place the formation of a <i>rawk</i> god began. Lessons started 
        and a man by the name of Jaret started molding and forming pure raw energy 
        into the well oiled refined playing machine that he is today. Starting 
        with the basic rudimentary beats and pentameter of <b>Pearl Jam</b> and 
        <b>Alice in Chains</b>, and finally graduating to the metal crunch of 
        <b>Metallica</b>. From then on the boy was being formed into what he is 
        today. For about 2 yrs. the boy lost all interest in his gifts. He spent 
        his time honing the dark majiks of southern folklore. It was a move that 
        once again jump started the prodigy into drums. From there he started 
        playing <i> from morning to night,</i> a couple of time the <b>law</b> 
        was called to make him stop. Little did they know that it just motivated 
        him to play <b>harder</b>, <b>louder</b> and <i><b>faster</b></i>. After 
        locking himself into his room for 3 yrs he felt it was time to surprise 
        the world with his playing abilities. According to urban legend he roams 
        around playing genre to genre, bestowing his gifts and talents to all 
        who wish to a part of them. He gives freely to those in need. Administers 
        justice to those who lack justice. He brings light to dark and night to 
        day. The hunter of the shadow is rising. He is here to stay to bring the 
        love of music to all who wish to hear. He is I and <i>I am him</i>, together 
        we join to form me. </div></td>
