Then I thought about the music of our <I>generation</I>, with <A href="http://www.britneyspears.com/" target=_blank>Britney</A>, <A href="http://www.drivenbyboredom.com/bling.htm" target=_blank>bling-bling</A><B> </B>and <A href="http://www.nsync.com/" target=_blank>boy bands</A>. There's no <I>soul</I> there. It's <B><I>hollow</I></B>. It's all about<B> big titty bitches and dance steps</B>. That's what we're <I>against</I>. We wanna bring back the <I>emotion</I> and <I>meaning</I> that seems to be missing in a lot of today's music. So that's why we called the band<B> Hollow Days</B>. It's a statement about our <I>culture</I>.&quot; </FONT></P>
      <P align=justify><FONT size=2><B></B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Hollow Days</B> 
        is a hard rock band out of <B>Gainesville</B> whose powerful, <I>high 
        energy</I> songs are making a strong <I>impression</I> on the Florida<B> 
        music scene</B>. Instead of trying to follow the trends of the moment, 
        the guys in<B> Hollow Day</B>s do what they know <I>best</I>: straight 
        up <I><B>solid hard rock</B></I>. Inspired and influenced by bands like 
        Black Sabbath, Stone Temple Pilots and Guns n' Roses, <a href="josh/">Josh 
        Mualdin (vocals)</a>,<A href="joe/"> Joe Herchel (guitar)</A>, 
        <a href="jeremy/">Jeremy Redding (bass, vocals)</a>, and<A href="luke/"> 
        Luke Pidgeon(drums)</A>, craft songs that are at once <B>original</B> 
        yet somehow <I>familiar</I>. Strong hooks, <I>soaring</I> choruses and 
        <I><B>killer groves</B></I> conduct the power and <I>emotion</I> of these 
        songs to the listener.<BR>
        <BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the short time the <B>band</B> has been together, they have built a <I>strong</I> following primarily due to the <B>strength</B> of their<I><B> live show</B></I>. Josh Mauldin is a <I>frontman</I> in every sense of the word, <B>commanding</B> the stage and crowd with his high level of <I>passion</I> and <I>energy</I>. He has a <B>great vocal range </B>and <I>incredible presence</I>. The man was <I>born</I> to perform! Speaking of performing, guitarist Joe Herchel is a<B> wild man </B>on stage, often appearing <I>possessed</I> by the music as he <I>effortlessly</I> peels off <B>blistering leads </B>and <B>bone crunching</B> riffs. "Guitar Joe", as he is called by fans, eats, sleeps and breathes <I>music</I>. Because of his many talents, Jeremy Redding could be considered the <I>glue</I> of the group, holding the songs together with<I> atmospheric&nbsp;</I> and creative bass playing. His voice blends with Josh's <EM>perfectly</EM>, adding a level of <B>depth</B> and <I>texture</I> most bands just don't have. If Jeremy is the glue, then Luke is definitely the <B>backbone</B>. His thunderous drum beats provide a <B>rock solid foundation </B>for the band. Blessed with an intuitive sense of <I>dynamics</I> and structure, his <I>powerful</I> drumming makes each song stand out. The <I>chemistry</I> these four have together is nothing short of amazing.<BR><BR>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recently the band entered <A href="http://www.recroomrecording.com/" target=_blank>Rec 
        Room Recording Studios</A> and cut three of their most popular tunes. 
        The resulting CD is an effective demonstration of the traits that helped 
        make the band so popular. Since its release, stations such as <A href="http://www.rock104.com/" target=_blank>Rock 
        104 103.7 FM</A>, <A href="http://www.wjrr.com/" target=_blank>Real Rock 
        101.1</A> and <A href="http://www.1005thebuzz.com/" target=_blank>The 
        Buzz 100.5 FM</A> have given the band airtime.<B> Hollow Days</B> has 
        played in <I>numerous</I> cities throughout Florida, and are currently 
        looking to expand their fan base the <I>old fashioned</I> way: getting 
        up on stage and putting on a <I><B>kick-ass rock show,</B></I> winning 
        the crowds over one person at a time. Though maintaining a website (www.hollowdays.com), 
        handling out and posting fliers, sending out updates to their mailing 
        list, contacting club owners, radio stations, other bands and various 
        media outlets can be grueling, these guys actually <I>enjoy</I> these 
        activities because they know that it will lead to yet another opportunity 
        to step on stage, <I>feel</I> the lights, hear the <B>crowd</B>, and <B>kick 
        out the jams</B>. </FONT></P>
