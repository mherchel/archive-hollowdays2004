        <p> What's up? This is <b>Joe</b>, <i>thanks</i> for checking my bio. 
          First thing I wanna say is how <i>cool</i> it is to be in a<i><b> kick 
          ass band </b></i>again. This is what I was <i>born</i> to do and I can't 
          wait to hit the stage. Now for some boring facts: Born in Pennsylvania 
          on Jan 17, 1978 (my mom says my first words were &quot;<b>Make some 
          Fuckin' Noise, Gainesville!</b>&quot; but I don't believe her) moved 
          to<b> Hobe Sound, Fla </b>when I was 12, now <i>I'm straight outta Compton</i>. 
          Anyway I've been playing guitar for a long time now, influenced and 
          inspired by guys like Randy Rhoads, Zakk Wylde, Slash, Jimmy Page... 
          you get the idea. Like most of those guys, I sling a <i>Les Paul</i>, 
          and as great as it is, it's <b>heavy</b>! In fact my left shoulder bone 
          has actually <i>grown</i> with a big curve in it where my guitar strap 
          sets. That's when you know you're <i><b>hardcore</b></i>, when your 
          bones grow around your instrument! <br>
