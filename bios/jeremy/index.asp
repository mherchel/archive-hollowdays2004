        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you call it fate... coincidence...the 
        alignment of the stars... the smiling of the rock gods...or just pure 
        luck when a chance meeting at a local rock show leads to your first audition 
        with your first band and lands you in a group destined for greatness? 
        Such is the story that finds me slapping bass with Hollow Days.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brand new to the Gainesville music scene, 
        I wandered into a Downpsychol show to satisfy a craving for some good 
        solid rock. There I met Joe, Luke &amp; Josh. Two days later I got a call, 
        and the rest will soon be, as they say, Rock &amp; Roll history.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I picked up the guitar for the first time 
        in my mid-teens, when I heard Mike McCready wail out State of Love and 
        Trust for the first time, and knew I had to learn to play it. When I held 
        that first Peavey Raptor and struck my first power chord, I could feel 
        the grungy distortion deafening my ears and giving birth to a beast within. 
        I have never felt so ALIVE. I don't really remember life before that, 
        and I still get that feeling every time I strap on a guitar. Later, I 
        discovered the raw power of the BASS (the REAL man's guitar) and fell 
        for it immediately.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love Rock... I love to listen... I love 
        to create... I love to play... and my god I love to perform. There is 
        NOTHING that compares to the rush you guys give me when you let me walk 
        on stage and give you a taste of that love. Stay Clean,<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeremy
