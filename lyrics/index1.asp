            <p>She was alone, abandoned by sanity<br>
              Sinking so low, hurt by all she sees<br>
              I don&#8217;t know where she goes when she leaves<br>

              Talked to the moon<br>
              Must be of angels<br>
              She&#8217;s gone too soon<br>
              Shadows on the walls, like fingers from the gave<br>
              Life has taken all, no memories to save<br>
              I don&#8217;t know where I&#8217;ll go when I leave<br>
              I sure hear her calling to me<br>
              I heard her calling, yes calling to me<br>
              I heard her say, come stay with me<br>
              She must be of angels, down in her tomb<br>
              Must be of angels, I&#8217;ll see her soon<br>
              She must be of angels (x 3)<br>
              She&#8217;s gone too soon<br>

              The gods repent and they breathe us in<br>
              The end is near, let the trip begin<br>
              I saw myself give my heart to the world<br>
              I saw myself spending my life with her<br>

              The faucet drips it&#8217;s ten to one<br>

              Take care little girl <br>
              While you&#8217;re off in your own world<br>
              Take care of yourself <br>
              Don&#8217;t you tell no one else<br>
              Why you&#8217;re crying to yourself<br>
              Feel like there&#8217;s no one left<br>
              Pain building up inside <br>
              Tell the people to run and hide<br>
              Envision all that I see<br>
              Young lovers love in their fight to be free<br>
              Four days of lies coming down on me<br>
              When it&#8217;s all over where will we be</p>

              The one question that I ask do you fear growing old<br>
              Tell me your deepest secret and I will make it so<br>
              Rearrange these idle thoughts that are spinning through my mind<br>

              Then you&#8217;ll be a face without a name<br>
              They eat my brain like a hungry child<br>
              The voice inside says lets get wild<br>
              They scar my face with the broken glass<br>
              My futures freedom a thing of the past<br>
              Streetlight, faded backdrop for the next show<br>
